Here are some notes about the 'tagger' feature of bird-slideshow.

tagger is a command line tools that allows you to manage tags for
files on your local filesystem.

It is modeled after the program 'tmsu'.

The idea is that it will eventually allow you to select the set of
files to display using tags, instead of using directory paths.

To do items for tagger:
 - support minimal 'tagger' command line options:
   - tagger help - show help overview
   - tagger help [command] - show help for a specific command
   - tagger init - create sqlite database in current directory
   - tagger tag [tag1] [tag2] ... -- [file1] [file2] ... - apply indicated tags to indicated files
   - tagger list-files [tag expression] - show list of files that match the tag expression
   - tagger list-tags - list all registered tags
